Chaos may feel and look like noise and appear unpredictable, yet it reveals rich, beautiful, and complex structures and patterns. Can Chaos be applied in machine learning? This talk will take us on a brief journey into the fascinating world of Chaos, culminating in an exploration of its potential applications in machine learning. \n\n Dr. Nithin Nagaraj holds a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK, Surathkal, 1999), a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Troy, New York, USA (2001), and a Ph.D. from the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru (NIAS, 2010). He has previously held positions at GE Global Research, IISER-Pune, and Amrita University. \n\n The technical talk provided a platform for in-depth discussions, knowledge sharing, and networking, making it a must-attend event for those interested in technological advancements. Held at 2:30 pm on 18th August 2023 in the DES Hitech Seminar Hall, the event began with an introduction to Dr. Nithin Nagaraj by Jamuna ma'am, followed by the commencement of the technical talk. Approximately 100-150 students from various years attended with great enthusiasm, making it a successful event lasting two hours, until 4:30 pm.",

It was a 2 hours quiz in which students were bombarded with multiple questions and multiple-choice questions.\n\n Since this is focused for 1st year students so all those questions were basic yet kind of challenging. Questions were framed in such a way that the freshers can gain more knowledge out of the quiz so that even if someone failed to get reward, the sense of knowledge will overpower the sense of defeat.\n\nOut of the three types some questions were chosen and named as Chocolate round. As the name says, in these round questions will be asked and whomsoever gives the answer fast and correct, he/she was awarded a chocolate. This kept the whole crowd engaged and motivated. \n\n Just like every other quiz, students were ranked based on their performance and prizes were given accordingly. Every students were awarded with a certificate. It was ranked as 1st, 2nd or 3rd or a console certificate so as to motivate the participants.\n\nThe event was conducted on 22nd of December around 3 PM under the guidance Faculty Coordinator Ms Jamuna S Murthy (Assistant Professor of Departmnet of CSE). \n\nWhen the quiz started, each participant was given a time of 1 minutes in order to solve the question and after every 30 minutes they were given questions for Chocolate round were asked. After these refreshments they were again given the usual questions. \n\nIn conclusion, the ACM’s TECHTREK was a great success, with participants displaying final scores which depicts their technical knowledge and ability to think faster and out of the box. The event was well-organized, and the orientation was conducted smoothly.The slogan. Techy techy everywhere can you sense it anywhere perfectly encapsulated the 2-hour thinking marathon and the determination and hard work displayed by the participants.",

Hosted by the ACM Student Chapter at RIT on May 9th, 2025, this offline showdown brought together over 70+ elite teams from multiple colleges, including RVCE and IISc. The twist? You had to solve tough DSA problems with the shortest possible code. Think HackerRank. Think sweat. Think obsession with shaving off \"every single character\".\n\nThe event was split into two brutal rounds. Round 1 hit with a mix of easy and medium-level problems. Then Round 2 turned up the heat — with hard-core DSA challenges that required both logic and code-golf strategy. Points were deducted for every extra character, making every semicolon count.\n\n🔥 Highlights:\n- Hosted on HackerRank using C, C++, Java, or Python\n- Strict rules: No AI tools, no online compilers, no copying — raw skill only\n- 20 AICTE activity points were awarded to all participants\n\n🥇 Winners:\n- 1st Place: \"TrieFecta\" — consistent leaderboard kings, took home ₹7,000\n- 2nd Place: \"Team MisFits\" — creative coders who sliced through edge cases — ₹5,000\n- 3rd Place: \"bhatakta Vaibhav\" — clean, efficient, and surgical with code — ₹3,000\n\n🧠 Bonus fun: A riddle break kept the vibes alive while judges calculated scores.\n\nJudges praised the participants’ grit and left them with golden advice: Focus on fundamentals, test edge cases like a maniac, and write code that's not just short — but smart. The event ended with certificates, photo sessions, and a whole lot of respect for clean code and competitive hustle.\n\nIn the end, CodeGolf 2025 proved this: It's not about writing 'more' code, it's about writing the 'right' code — with less.",
