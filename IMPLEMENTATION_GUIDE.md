   Create `.env` file:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/acm-rit
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Build TypeScript**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Start server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or for development
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

## üîê Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**
   - User creates account with name, email, password, team
   - Password hashed with bcryptjs (salt rounds: 10)
   - User stored in MongoDB

2. **Login**
   - User provides email and password
   - Backend validates credentials
   - JWT token generated (30-day expiry)
   - Token stored in localStorage

3. **Protected Routes**
   - Frontend checks for token in localStorage
   - If missing, redirects to `/login`
   - Backend verifies token validity
   - Request rejected if token invalid/expired

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### TypeScript
- Backend uses TypeScript with strict mode
- Frontend uses TypeScript for type safety
- All models fully typed with interfaces

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks on all async operations
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- User-friendly error messages

### Security
- JWT authentication on all protected endpoints
- Password hashing before storage
- CORS enabled for frontend origin only
- Input validation on all endpoints

### Performance
- Indexed database queries on userId, email
- Pagination-ready for large datasets
- Async operations for file uploads
