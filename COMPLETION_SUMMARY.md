| **Social Media** | Posts, Scheduling, Engagement | Multi-platform posting |
| **Publicity** | View-only access | Can see events and resources |
| **Coverage** | View-only access | Can see events and resources |
| **Technical** | All features + Admin | System-wide oversight |

### Approval Workflows
- Posters: Private by default → Admin/Technical approval → Public visibility
- Leave: Submit → Lead review → Approve/Reject
- Social Posts: Draft → Scheduled/Posted → Track engagement

### Data Management
- Full CRUD for events, resources, posters, posts
- Ownership tracking (createdBy, designedBy, postedBy)
- Soft delete support (isActive flag)
- Timestamp tracking on all records
- Team-based access restrictions
