# Backend Setup Complete - Summary

## ✅ What's Been Created

I've created a complete **Express.js backend** for the ACM-RIT website with the following structure:

## 📝 API Endpoints Ready

### Auth Endpoints
```

GET    /api/auth/me               # Get current user (protected)
```

PUT    /api/leaves/:leaveId/status # Update leave status (protected)
```

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create .env file:**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/acm-rit
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 16
- **MongoDB** (local or MongoDB Atlas connection string)
- **npm** or **yarn**

## 📌 Important Notes

✅ **What's Ready:**
- Full authentication system with 6 team options
- Leave management endpoints
- JWT security middleware
- Input validation
- Error handling

⏳ **What You Need to Tell Me:**
1. Should we create 6 separate dashboard pages in Next.js (one for each team)?
2. What specific features/data should each team dashboard show?
3. Who should be able to approve leaves? (Team heads, chapter officers?)
4. Any additional permissions needed for different roles?

**Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅**
Backend is ready to use. Next phase requires frontend integration!
